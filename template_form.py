        'Which photos should get final edits for publishing? Vote here! [_SUBTITLE_]',
        'description':
        "Hi friend! It was a pleasure shooting photos for/with/of you. I've gone through the photos and selected some for final editing. On every photo shoot there are some that just don't come out, so I've culled out the ones that had unfixable flaws. There still remain a fair amount of candidates which are good enough to spend the time to do final edits. The question is which ones? I have my favorites, but I've found that sometimes folks feel differently than me about which they prefer the most.\n\nSo in the interest of getting them out quickly and involving others in the selection process, you can use this form to select your favorites from the drafts of the photos I took. Please remember that they have very little to no editing done at this point, so they are not ready for sharing even if you like them as-is. Instead, use this form to vote on your favorites, and I'll focus my time on editing those.\n\nPlease fill out this form to indicate which photos in the set you like best, leave me notes, etc. Please do not share any of these photos at this stage. To remind you of this, I've added a small watermark to each one. I'll share over higher quality ones without a watermark after editing. Other common issues include: too bright or dark, color looks weird, not straight, etc. I'll make sure to correct as much of that as possible in editing.\n\nAfter editing, I will provide a few shots for the venue and promotion crew to use on social media, the web site, etc. I will also provide these to you exported at low resolution (Instagram post size). You may also purchase as many full resolution shots as you like at $10 per final edited photo. Just indicate that on the form below. Please consider purchasing some as this helps to fund my photography habit!\n\nYour feedback is greatly appreciated! Hope you enjoy looking through these. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!",
